SHOPPING CART WEB APPLICATION

Display a list of items (including their images) in a JSP page. The items should be
stored in a database and displayed from database. You can use whichever database you
are comfortable with (Oracle SQL, MySQL etc.) The list of items should be generated
dynamically depending on the number of items in your database. The list should not
be hard-coded inside your web page.

can use ArrayList object for the cart]
There should be proper session management (login, logout) in the project.
• Use Servlets, Filters, JSPs, Java Beans as required.
